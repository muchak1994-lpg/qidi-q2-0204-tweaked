# Changelog

## Unreleased
- New module `fluidd-drying-button`: a "Filament drying" entry in Fluidd's left panel and a window with the
  printer screen's own settings and commands (tested: lower the bed, start, time left, stop).
- New module `screen-drying-layout`: on the screen's drying page the time and temperatures are shown in one
  line instead of overlapping the step list (checked on the screen).
- New module `drying-skip-homing`: filament drying preparation homes only when needed (tested from the
  screen and from Fluidd).

## 0.9.0-rc2 - 2026-11-10
- Installer recognises earlier versions of its own files (`modules/LOCK-history.json`, `previous` edits
  for configuration files) and upgrades them instead of refusing.

  official package.
- Clearer message when a printer has other modifications (what to do first).
- `install.bat`: guided install for Windows (double-click).
- `screen/README.md`, automatic offline tests on GitHub (Python 3.9 and 3.13), problem-report template.
- Macro comments in English (park-rear-right).

## 0.9.0-rc1 - 2026-11-10
